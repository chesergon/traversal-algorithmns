Traversal Algorithms
Welcome to the Traversal Algorithms repository! This repository contains implementations and explanations of various graph and tree traversal algorithms. These algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are widely used in various applications such as searching, sorting, and network analysis.

Algorithms Included
Depth-First Search (DFS)

Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
Utilizes a stack (either via recursion or an explicit stack data structure).
Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
Utilizes a queue to keep track of the next location to visit.
In-Order Traversal (Binary Trees)

Visits the left subtree, the root, and then the right subtree.
Used primarily in binary search trees to retrieve values in a sorted order.
Pre-Order Traversal (Binary Trees)

Visits the root node, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
Useful for creating a copy of the tree.
Post-Order Traversal (Binary Trees)

Visits the left subtree, the right subtree, and then the root node.
Commonly used for deleting nodes in a tree.
Level-Order Traversal

Visits nodes level by level from top to bottom.
Similar to BFS but specifically used in tree structures.
